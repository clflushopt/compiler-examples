# Compiler Examples

This repo contains various reference implementations of compiler related data 
structures and algorithms.

Most of the following was initially done while working through Cornell's CS6120
[course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/self-guided/) from
the course assignments, reading papers, LLVM's codebase and various books.

See the reference section below for more details.

## Why

The idea of `compiler-examples` as a set of minimally viable implementations
of datastructures and algorithms in compilers came as a result of frustration
with existing ways compilers are taught and explained. I wanted to have a good
reference I can always go back to when I am working on a problem, most compiler
books have very little practical examples instead spending most of the time on
things which are largely irrelevant, my goal was to essentially remediate this
lack of examples and implementations in a very approachable manner using mostly
Python 3.

I hope you enjoy hacking on it as much as I enjoyed writing.
